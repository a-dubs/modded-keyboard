# Fully Upgraded $40 RGB Mechanical Keyboard
This is the boilerplate for all my personal projects on GitHub. (This is the brief description for this repository)

<br>

## Summary
- Fully modified my cheap yet surprisingly reliable 75% RGB mechanical keyboard.  
- Transfered the o-rings from the old keycaps to the new blank fog-white transluscent keycaps.  
- Removed all the old switches, then desoldered all ~150 hot-swap sockets which were too small for the new switches, and then soldered in all the new Gateron Clear linear switches.  
- Cleaned the plate and case, added sound dampening foam to inside the keyboard, and added dampening to the various loose stabalizers to reduce noise.   
- Had to do 6 pcb trace and throughhole repairs due to damage sustained from desoldering and resoldering since to the pcb is super cheap.  
- Took roughly 25 hours and 300 solders. Worth it! Looks and feels infinitely better.  
- Keycaps used: [PBT OEM Fog White Keycaps](https://kbdfans.com/products/pbt-oem-fog-white-keycaps?variant=34166308995211)
- Switches used: [Gateron Clear Linear Switch Plate Mount 35g Actuation Force](https://www.amazon.com/Switches-Underglow-Compatible-Mechanical-Transparent/dp/B07K8464CR/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=gateron%2Bclear&qid=1614068952&sr=8-2&th=1)
